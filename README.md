# Emacs.d

This is my emacs configuration. It aims to be *simple* and *lean*

## Notes

This setup is tested on Emacs 30, this means some packages are already built-in, such as:

- `use-package`
- `pdf-tools` with `emacsPackages.pdf-tools`

Additionally the theme custom module assumes you are running Gnome
